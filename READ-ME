Wall Following Robot Assignment
-------------------------------

This is from my assignment from my Robotics module where I had to write a code to program into a simulated autonomous robot to
follow the wall on its left. A back propogation neural network was implemented so as to allow the robot to learn and correct itself.

You will need a robot simulator software to run this program.

The robot managed to stay close to the wall and completed a given map to follow with minimum error.
